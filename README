= TALCL: A libary that implements the TAL template language for common lisp =

This library is a significant branch of the TAL implementation found in arnesi / ucw

== Primary Goals ==
 * To make working with templates (particularly XML/HTML) simple and
   support designer type folks working on them.

 * To be more flexible, easier to use, easier to debug, and with more
   helpful error messages than the original TAL from arnesi and ucw.
   TAL now has a single execution environment (the common lisp env)
   rather than its own private tal environment.

 * integrate well with cxml dom & our buildnode library.  We want to
   be able to embed template content into our dom document in an 
   efficient manner.  Currently these are stored as processing 
   instructions in the dom, and in serialization we play out the sax
   events we buffered when processing the template

== Changes From Arnesi / UCW tal ==
 * A single environment (tal environment is used only to pass values as 
   parameters); TAL processing occurs in the standard common lisp runtime.
   TAL package determines what is currently available.

 * Fixed inconsistencies about "$var" in non tal tags vs "var" in tal
   tags. $var should now work everywhere whether or not the tag or
   attribute is tal

 * tal expression strings work in the body of a tag as well as
   attributes

 * $$ escapes to a single $ sign
 * $ evaluates one expression 
  * $var and ${var} returns the value of the var
  * $(some-fn var) - calls some-fn with the value of var in the current
    package / env and splices the return into the doc
  * ${nil} doesnt print anything

 * DOM nodes and lists / vectors of dom-nodes can be spliced into the
   template EG: <span>$some-dom-content</span> will correctly put the
   dom content into the template
